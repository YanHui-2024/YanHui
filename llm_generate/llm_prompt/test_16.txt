# API: JIT Overloading
# Bug description: The following code fails to compile for the reason given in Traceback (in PyTorch v1.7.0):
#                  It would be nice if we could suppress type comments with an annotation, like:
#                      @jit._overload_method(ignore_name=True) ?
#                  Note that I can remove the name and comment without warnings when decorating `forward` in `Foo`
# PR Title: Torchscript does not work with type: ignore comments for mypy
from torch import nn, jit, Tensor


class Bar(nn.ModuleDict):
    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:  # type: ignore[override]
        pass


bar = Bar()
