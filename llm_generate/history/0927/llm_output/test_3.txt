# API: Saving and loading ScriptModules
# Bug description: JIT trace cache is being shared across processes when using the
#                  multiprocessing module. The JIT compiler caches traced functions to avoid recompiling them every time a
#                  new process is spawned, but this means that two processes cannot run simultaneously without risk of deadlocks, as
#                  they would both attempt to acquire the cache lock at the same time.
