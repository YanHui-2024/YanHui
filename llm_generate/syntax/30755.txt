# API: static method invocation in jit scripting model
# Bug description: Trace sanity check fails when using @staticmethod function defined inside __init__.
#                  It will report an error saying that the static method is not found on that class.
#                  It seems that static methods are only compiled if they are invoked from a forward, not from __init__().
#                  The same error occurs with @classmethod also.
class M(nn.Module):
    @staticmethod
    def some_method(x):
        return x + 10

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.some_method(x)

torch.jit.script(M())
