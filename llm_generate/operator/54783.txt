# API: scripting
# Bug description: Fail on autodiff in JIT code, with backtrace to ir/IR.cpp line 1110.
#                  Failure happens when the second pass of backward scripting is run, after graph was copied and reconstructed.
#                  This failure can also be reproduced by only running method() once.
# PRIORITY: p2 (Highest priority if you are impacted by this)
# TRIAGE STATUS: need to be triaged as it breaks the backward pass.
