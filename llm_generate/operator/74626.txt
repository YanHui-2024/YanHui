# API: JIT Attribute type
# Bug description: Jitted module can not access its properties of the correct type, which are defined as a torch.jit.Attribute on construction. The properties work properly during model execution but fail when inspecting a property as it is a JIT Attributes that is stored in the model graph and loaded back in again using the .script method.
