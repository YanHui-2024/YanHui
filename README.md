# ISSTA24-1323 Artifact Evaluation

YanHui Prototype

## Environment

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

## Components

- `0_collect_data.ipynb`: The preliminaries, including data collection and pre-processing script.
- `1_concentation.ipynb`: The process of extracting information from the collected data.
- `2_diffusion.ipynb`: The process of generate test cases for model optimization bugs.
- `3_evaluation.ipynb`: The evaluation part of the paper.

## Demo

Due to the time limitation (3 days), we can only bundle **full raw data** and **partial intermediate data** in the artifact, which is only for demonstration purposes.

The complete output data will be progressively released in the GitHub repository: <https://github.com/YanHui-2024/YanHui>.
