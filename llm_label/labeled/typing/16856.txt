# API: JIT model, type is not inferred correctly
# Bug description: Model fails to convert due to unordered_map type mismatch error.
#                  This problem occurs when trying to trace using a custom type that has multiple constructors.
#                  We believe this is a bug in the torch.jit module, and have created an issue with them: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/39756

        # type: (List[Dict[str, Tensor]]) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor] # noqa
