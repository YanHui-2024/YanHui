 torch.jit.trace (python thread)
# Bug description: 
#                  When calling `torch.jit.load` from a python thread other than the main one, it hangs indefinitely.
#                  For example, running the code below will hang indefinitely:
#                  ```
#                      def dummy_worker(filepath):
#                          traced = torch.jit.load(filepath)
#                  filepath = "dummy_model.pt" 
#                      threading.Thread(target=dummy_worker, args=[filepath]).start()
#                      ````
#                  The same code works if called from the main thread.
